<h1>Submitting Data to PeanutBase</h1>
<div  style="background: #f0f0f0; color: Red;">
TO DO:<br/>
* Modify(prepend 'https://peanutbase.org/') links below to original PB site for now to make it functional<br/>
* /files/qtls/user_genetic_template.xlsx  https://peanutbase.org/files/qtls/user_genetic_template.xlsx<br/>
* Later find how/where to store these data files, LIS DS or somewhere else.<br/>

<!--  Content from https://peanutbase.org/submit_data page -->
<p>PeanutBase is a community resource dedicated to making research results broadly available as soon after publication as possible. Researchers can help us meet this objective by submitting their data directly. Our curators can also help to clean up and properly present data at PeanutBase prior to publication. It will be helpful if you <a href="/contact">contact us</a> before submitting your data so that we can help you through the process.</p>
<p>We currently accept QTLs and maps and markers (see below). Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a><a></a> if you have a different type of data you would like PeanutBase to host and we will work with you to make that happen.</p>
<p>All data types use the same spreadsheet template.<br />

<p><strong>QTL</strong><br />
We are working with the plant research community to create a standard template that is <a href="http://miqas.sourceforge.net/">MIQAS</a> compliant and that can be used across multiple plant species. The current template is available at the link above. We would like to work with you to load your QTL data so that it is available online at or shortly after publication.</p>
<p>The template asks for basic information about your publication, description of the experiment replicates, information about the maps used — which may be described in a different publication — and the QTL themselves (names, trait descriptions, map positions, names of associated markers if any, measurements). The worksheet named 'MARKERS" need not be filled in.</p>
<p>You can see the QTL that are loaded into PeanutBase <a href="/search/qtl&quot;">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Maps and Markers</strong><br />
PeanutBase and its partner, the Legume Information System (LIS) are collecting maps for peanut and its wild relatives. If you have a map you would like loaded into PeanutBase, <a href="/contact">let us know</a> and download the submission template above. You will need to fill in only the worksheets describing your publication and map(s): PUB, MAP_DESCRIPTION and LINKAGE_GROUPS, and the worksheet describing the markers, MARKERS. The worksheets named 'REPLICATES' and 'QTL' need not be filled in.</p>
<p>All maps are presented in <a href="http://cmap.comparative-legumes.org/">CMap</a> and cmap-js, as well as described in <a href="chado/featuremap">record pages</a>.</p>
