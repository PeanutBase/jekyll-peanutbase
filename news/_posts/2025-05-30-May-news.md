**Traits: their genes, loci and markers info collection**<br/>
We have started collecting information about genes, loci and associated markers for important agronomic traits-- starting this month with <b>"Flowering time"</b> and <b>"Seed size"</b>. This information is useful in genomic-informed breeding programs involving these traits. The content has been created using AI tools and hence should be used with caution and need to be cross checked with the included references. Go to <b>[Traits, Loci & Markers](/traits-genes-markers/)</b> page.

Example:
GenBank RefSeq annotation for Genome assembly 1 for Arachis stenosperma, genotype V10309 is now available at PeanutBase. The primary source of this data is [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/Arachis_stenosperma/GCF_014773155.1-RS_2023_06/){:target="_blank"}. The files are in our [DataStore](https://data.legumeinfo.org/Arachis/stenosperma/){:target="_blank"} and you can look at other available resources at [PeanutBase species resources page](/taxa/arachis/)(please scroll down).
