**New genome assembly for <i>A. cardenasii</i>, a diploid relative of peanut.**

The genome of <i>Arachis cardenasii</i>, a relative of cultivated peanut, has been sequenced and is available here (with some usage restrictions) at the [PeanutBase Data Store](https://peanutbase.org/data/v2/Arachis/cardenasii/). This diploid wild species has been used as an important source of disease resistance in cultivated tetraploid peanut. Genome sequencing was funded by the USDA (Dr. Brian Scheffler leading), under the scientific guidance of Drs. David and Soraya Bertioli and colleagues.
