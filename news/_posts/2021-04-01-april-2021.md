**Arachis Phenotype server**

Phenotype data server for PeanutBase is now operational at [ArachisPheno](https://arachispheno.peanutbase.org/). We now have the phenotype data for the peanut mini core collection: [agronomic traits](https://arachispheno.peanutbase.org/study/1/) and [seed biochemical traits](https://arachispheno.peanutbase.org/study/2/). If you have phenotype data for peanut lines to share with the community, please contact us to house it at PeanutBase, or you may try a [self submission](https://arachispheno.peanutbase.org/submission/) too.
