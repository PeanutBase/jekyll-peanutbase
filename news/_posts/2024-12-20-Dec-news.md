**Gene and Trait Search Boxes on Front Page**<br/>
Upon feedback from community we have added Keyword search, Gene ID search and synteny search boxes on the front page.

**Immediate Access to Commonly Used Features**<br/>
We have added buttons to the front page for commonly used features, such as, BLAST, Gene Search, Genotype Comparison, etc. 

**Legacy PeanutBase Site Removed**<br/>
We have removed the legacy PeanutBase site(legacy.peanutbase.org) in order to comply with goverment policy on unsupported softwares.
