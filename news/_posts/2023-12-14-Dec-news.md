+ **Expression data quality metrics are now available**: We have made available the quality metrics, [MultiQC report](/expression/Clevenger2016_nfcore_multiqc/multiqc_report.html){:target="_blank"} with interactive graphics, for the expression dataset (Clevenger 2016) remapped to Tifrunner.gnm2.ann2. Links for expression related data have been compiled at the [Gene Expression Resources](/expression) page.  


+ **Userguide updated with gene family search**: We have added instructions for [finding gene family](/userguides/genefamily/geneToFamily.html) starting from a gene-id, phylogram or the tree view along with other members from legumes in our userguides collection.
