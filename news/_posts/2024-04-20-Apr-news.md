**Comparing multiple genotypes in Flapjack format using Gigwa**  
- We have taken advantage of the recent version of our Gigwa tool which provides a flapjack view of multiple genotypes using diversity data. All userguides are accessible from our [Help](/help/) page and the step by step instructions for  
-- [multiple genotype comparison](/userguides/gigwa/gigwa_flapjack.html) and    
-- similarity and differences of [one to many genotypes](/userguides/gigwa/gigwa-one-to-all.html) using Gigwa are here.  
**Enhanced instructions for genome structure comparison**
- [Other userguides](/userguides/jb2/jb2_genomeStrCompare.html) are being enhanced with images(result after following the instructions).

Example:
GenBank RefSeq annotation for Genome assembly 1 for Arachis stenosperma, genotype V10309 is now available at PeanutBase. The primary source of this data is [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/Arachis_stenosperma/GCF_014773155.1-RS_2023_06/){:target="_blank"}. The files are in our [DataStore](https://data.legumeinfo.org/Arachis/stenosperma/){:target="_blank"} and you can look at other available resources at [PeanutBase species resources page](/taxa/arachis/)(please scroll down).
