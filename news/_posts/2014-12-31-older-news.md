  - (New) Genotype Comparison Visualization Tool, [GCViT](/tools/gcvit.html): It is a tool for whole genome visualization of resequencing or SNP array data. GCViT allows a user to compare two or more accessions and visually identify regions of similarity and difference across the genome.
<br>It is capable of multiple chromosome visualisation for the comparison of multiple accessions from a single dataset. It extracts information from VCF file and does a parallel comparison between two or more lines within that VCF file plotting the location of these differences on the chromosome for visualization. One can, for example, plot the differences between progeny and its parents to identify which regions are inherited from which parents. (More information and a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2gPVUipWo0) about GCViT is at [GitHub](https://github.com/LegumeFederation/gcvit) and [SoyBase](https://soybase.org/gcvit/).)

Here is a [view of the Genome Browser showing such a comparison](https://peanutbase.org/gb2/gbrowse/Aradu1.0/?start=95781580;stop=95791579;ref=Aradu.A01;width=1024;version=100;flip=0;grid=1;l=assembly_supercontigs%1Earachis_hypogaea_guo%1Eglycine_max_gene_models%1Ephaseolus_vulgaris_gene_models).

**(May 2014)**

  - Pseudomolecule assemblies as 80 column multifasta files are now available for download
<br>We have made available the genome assemblies in a single 80 column multi-FASTA file, one for each diploid genome. These files contain the 10 pseudomolecule sequences in a 80 column format with the scaffold sequences concatenated (after ordering and orienting) and separated by spacer sequences of 10,000 "n"s. This format is compatible with some programs like IGV which requires the sequence lines be of equal width. They are available via our [Genomes](https://peanutbase.org/genomes) (assembly) page and labeled in the corresponding dipoid pages as follows:

|  Aradu_v1.0.fa.gz  |  01-May-2014 14:26  |  251M  |  Pseudomolecules, one file  |
|  Araip_v1.0.fa.gz  |  01-May-2014 14:36  |  338M  |  Pseudomolecules, one file  |

  - BLAST and BLAT: Sequence search features are now available at PeanutBase
<br>Sequence search feature is now available at PeanutBase via BLAST and BLAT utilities. You can search your sequence against <i>Arachis duranensis</i> (assembly ver 1.0) or <i>Arachis ipaensis</i> (assembly ver 1.0) in the [ARACHIS BLAST](https://peanutbase.org/arachis_blast) page (the general purpose NCBI BLAST sequence search utility appropriate for genomic sequences).
<br>OR,
<br>you can use the BLAT alignment tool via the GBrowse pages for [<i>Arachis duranensis</i>](https://peanutbase.org/gb2/gbrowse/Aradu1.0) and [<i>Arachis ipaenensis</i>](https://peanutbase.org/gb2/gbrowse/Araip1.0). The BLAT alignment is recommended for aligning cDNA sequences against the corresponding assembly sequence.
<br>
<br>The steps for BLAT alignment are (at the GBrowse page):
    1. Select "Find Blat Alignment" in the drop-down menu for Configure.
    2. Click "Configure"
    3. In the "Find Blat Alignment" section that opens, enter your (single) sequence in the "Input Sequence to Align" box
    4. Click "Find"

    If a single hit is found, a new track called "BLAT" will be created in the genome browser with your aligned sequence. If multiple hits are found, you'll have to select one from a list of locations.

    If you have questions or need further assistance please [contact us](/contact).

**(April 2014)**

  - Genome Browser is now accessible for the two <i>Arachis</i> diploid progenitors.

  - QTL terms with ontology compiled and available for download
<br>Ontologies will be an integral part at PeanutBase and we are trying to make them consistent with those for other legume species, with specialized terms for peanut where necessary, and with synonyms for existing terms in the literature and in use. This will help towards enabling searches that will integrate trait information for multiple legume species provided by LegumeInfo.org, and will allow integration with other plant genetic databases. As of November, 2013, peanut QTL terms have been collected from published resources and are being aligned/integrated with the trait ontology developed at SoyBase. We have made this evolving resource, [QTL terms with ontology](https://peanutbase.org/files/qtls/Arachis_traits.xls), available for download as an excel spreadsheet. We also welcome and encourage [comments and suggestions](/contact) from the community about this resource.
