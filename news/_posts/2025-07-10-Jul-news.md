* **C76-16, F07, ICG1471 genome assemblies with annotations**  
We have now three more sequenced genomes with annotations for important cultivars used in peanut breeding, viz., C76-16, Florida 07(F07) and ICG1471. The sequences were contributed by the community-- Josh Clevenger's group at HudsonAlpha Institute and Peggy OZias-Akins group at the UGA. The annotations were done by PeanutBase after liftover from the reference Tifrunner gnm2.ann2 version.  ......  Please look at them at JB here.  .. At DS here.
* [Genome assemblies](https://data.legumeinfo.org/Arachis/hypogaea/genomes/) at DataStore.  
* [Annotations](https://data.legumeinfo.org/Arachis/hypogaea/annotations/) also at our DataStore.    
* [In genome browser](https://www.peanutbase.org/tools/jbrowse2/?config=config.json&session=share-VvagpvfjS8&password=R192J) showing the three along with the Tifrunner reference of a seed size related gene.

Example:
GenBank RefSeq annotation for Genome assembly 1 for Arachis stenosperma, genotype V10309 is now available at PeanutBase. The primary source of this data is [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/Arachis_stenosperma/GCF_014773155.1-RS_2023_06/){:target="_blank"}. The files are in our [DataStore](https://data.legumeinfo.org/Arachis/stenosperma/){:target="_blank"} and you can look at other available resources at [PeanutBase species resources page](/taxa/arachis/)(please scroll down).
