**DSCensor**<br/>
[DSCensor](https://dscensor.legumeinfo.org/multiqc-demo/genome_main:arachis): Shows the summary statistics of assembly data.<br/>
**[Gigwa2.5](/gigwa/):Genotype comparison**<br/>
Now it is possible to visualize variants between multiple lines within Gigwa(v2.5). This is achieved by selecting multiple individuals for display and then download and export as flapjack file format. The 'keep files in server' should be selected before export. Finaly, a click at 'View in Flapjack-Bytes' draws the visualization showing similarity and differences between the genetic lines at each of the SNPs.
