**Peanut mini core image catalog**

These images were taken to document unique traits of each accession during a large-scale project to comprehensively catalog the peanut core and mini core collection. Now the images of the accessions in the mini core collection are available as a [catalog](https://peanutbase.org/germplasm/catalogs). (Contributor: Noelle Anglin, USDA-ARS)
