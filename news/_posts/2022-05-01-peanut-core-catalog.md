**Peanut core catalog**

These images were taken to document unique traits of each accession during a large-scale project
to comprehensively catalog the peanut core and mini core collection.
Now the images of the accessions in the core collection are available as a
[catalog](https://peanutbase.org/germplasm/catalogs).
