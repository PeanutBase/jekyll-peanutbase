  description: "Use and development of formal ontologies are essential. We are working with other legume communities
    to create a consistent trait terminology, using specialized terms for peanut where necessary. This will enable
    PeanutBase to integrate with trait information for multiple legume species available at LegumeInfo.org (external link)
    and other plant genetic databases. Peanut QTL data are collected from published resources; we then apply our standard
    trait terminology and definitions before presentation on the site. We have made the evolving trait terminology
    available for download as an excel spreadsheet."
