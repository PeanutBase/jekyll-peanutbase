  background_info: "Reaction to Late Leaf Spot (LLS) is caused by the fungus <i>Phaeoisariopsis personata</i>. Late leaf spot (LLS) is a major foliar disease that reduces the pod yield and severely affects the fodder and seed quality in groundnut."
  details: "TO:0000439
<br/>Trait synonyms: Fungal disease resistance, LLS res, Late Leaf Spot resistance (<i>Phaeoisariopsis personata</i>)
The organism was previously known as <i>Cercospora personata</i>, <i>Cercosporidium personatum</i>, and <i>Mycosphaerella berkeleyi</i>.
<p>
Late leaf spot (LLS) and rust are two major foliar diseases of peanut that often occur together leading to 50–70% yield loss in the crop. The symptoms of LLS are circular and darker spots appear on the lower surface of the leaves and also forms in stems and pegs resulting in severe yield loss to the groundnut growers. LLS also has an adverse influence on seed quality as well as on quality of haulms. The regular incidence of the above disease under late sown conditions warrants the development of resistant cultivars in groundnut. Though there are many chemical control methods available, development of disease resistant varieties is the best way to control the disease to improve production quality and reduce the adverse effects of chemicals on our ecosystem.

  background_info: "<i>Meloidogyne arenaria</i>, Chitwood race 1 (rootknot nematode [RKN]), damage to peanut roots and pods causes significant economic loss in infested fields. A gene for nematode resistance, Rma (resistance to <i>M. arenaria</i>), from <i>Arachis cardenasii</i> (a wild peanut relative), has been introgressed into cultivated peanut through either interspecific hybridization involving a synthetic tetraploid (<i>Arachis batizocoi</i> × [<i>A.cardenasii</i> × <i>Arachis diogoi</i>]) crossed with <i>A. hypogaea</i> or a hexaploid introgression pathway (<i>A. hypogaea</i> × <i>A. cardenasii</i>). The synthetic tetraploid approach, using ‘Florunner’ as the recurrent female parent to introgress Rma, has yielded the resistant cultivars COAN and Nema-TAM. The introgressed region carrying Rma has been found to be collinear with a portion of chromosome 9A and is shared with Tifguard, a high-yielding elite cultivar with near immunity to RKN and high resistance to tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV)."
  details: "Reaction to <i>Meloidogyne arenaria</i> damage and the QTL symbol is &quot;Peanut root-knot nematode&quot;.

<p>
Approximately 50% of peanut seed dry weight is oil of which oleic acid and linoleic acid account for 80% of the total fatty acid. Normal O:L cultivars such as Tifguard have an O:L ratio of 1.0 to 4.0 whereas the ratio can reach as high as 30 to 40 in high O:L cultivars. The high O:L trait is desired by the peanut industry because it confers high oxidative stability to the oil. The reported health benefits of dietary monounsaturated fatty acids, such as lowering of blood low-density lipoprotein levels in postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women, also makes the conversion of current elite cultivars to high O:L attractive. Delta-12-desaturase (oleoyl-PC desaturase), which catalyzes the addition of a second double bond into oleic acid to make linoleic acid, is the key enzyme regulating the O:L ratio in peanut (Ray et al., 1993). Spontaneous recessive mutants for this enzyme, identified and double mutants have high O:L. Expression of two homeologous genes encoding this enzyme, ahFAD2A and ahFAD2B, must be repressed to achieve high O:L in peanut. ol1 and ol2, have been identified and double mutants have high O:L. Expression of two homeologous genes encoding this enzyme, ahFAD2A and ahFAD2B, must be repressed to achieve high O:L in peanut.

  background_info: "Leaf rust, caused by <i>Puccinia arachidis</i>, is a widespread disease in peanut that leads to severe yield losses in almost all peanut growing countries. Together with late leaf spot, leaf rust causes signifcant decrease in productivity and fodder quality in peanut."
  details: "Trait synonyms: Fungal disease resistance, Leaf Rust (<i>Puccinia arachidis</i> Speg)
<p>
Peanut leaf rust is caused by <i>Puccinia arachidis</i>. The synonym terms used for this fungus are <i>Bullaria arachidis</i> (Speg.) Arthur & Mains, (1922) and <i>Uromyces arachidis</i> Henn. (1896) <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puccinia_arachidis'>[Wikipedia]</a>. The term rust is used for both the disease and the causative fungus (Sillero et al., 2006).
<p>
The disease symptoms can be recognized by the appearance of orange pustules on the lower surface of the leaves. The rupturing of these pustules expose masses of reddish brown urediniospores which leads to the spread of infection to the neighboring plants. In highly susceptible genotypes, secondary pustules might surround the original pustules. Later, pustules may form on the upper surface corresponding to the position on the lower surface of leaf. These pustules develop on all the plant parts except flowers. Pustules are usually circular in shape that ranges from 0.5 to 1.4mm in diameter. Rust infection lead to dried and necrotic leaves which stay intact with the plant. The disease is usually spread through urediniospores by air, infected crop debris like surface contaminated pods, seeds or dried leaves. However, spread through seed borne pathogen or germplasm exchange is not evident. Leaf rust can cause infection to plants at any development age. Also, warm and humid weather can facilitate the spread of this fungus. Under favorable circumstances, leaf rust can spread to the entire field and can cause desiccation of all the plants. Early season rust infection may lead to significant yield losses as compared to late season rust epidemics (Sillero et al., 2006; Rashid & Bernier, 1991). In essence, severe disease infection can lead to approximately 50% of the yield losses.
