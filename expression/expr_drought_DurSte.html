<i>A. duranensis</i> X Drought expression: stress vs. control comparison<br>
From this table, one can easily obtain the number of differentially expressed genes (log2FC > 2 or < -2, FDR < 0.05) between drought and control. For example, for the cell of stress vs up (vs.control), the number 697 means there are 697 genes are up-regulated in this comparison.  Clicking on the cell will result in a downloadable list of genes with their <a href ="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19910308" target="_blank">edgeR</a> analysis results, including log2FoldChange (log2FC) and adjusted-pvalue (FDR). In addition, gene GBrowse, sequence link and functional annotation are also included for further exploration.<br><br>

Credits: Libraries were sequenced at Fasteris using HI-Seq2000 and the transcripts were mapped into the <i>A. duranensis</i> reference genome. Drought data was produced by Ana Cristina Miranda Brasileiro and colleagues. Reference: Brasileiro AC, et al. (2015) Transcriptome Profiling of Wild Arachis from Water-Limited Environments Uncovers Drought Tolerance Candidate Genes. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26752807" target="_blank">(PubMed)</a><br><br>

Usage agreement: These data and analyses are being made available to peanut researchers, prior to publication, to facilitate research toward crop improvement and understanding of peanut biology, with the expectation and desire by the authors (see above) to publish this data in a reasonable time without preemption by other groups.
